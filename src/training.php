		<br><p>Outside of the half hour weekly call, there are a handful of responsibilities that we will require you to complete.
		These allow us to support you and your partner in every way. For example, if either of you could not make a phone call, 
		we would have this on record and be able to check if the arrangement is working out.
		<ol>
			<li>Making a call to an older person for up to 30 minutes at the same time every week.
			<li>Letting us know if you cannot make a call so we can cover it for you.
			<li>Letting us know if your telephone friend doesnâ€™t answer the phone and you are no longer able to carry on trying.
			<li>Completing Charitylog after every call (refer to the presentation slides to learn how to do this) to let us know your telephone friend is safe and well.
			<li>Keeping any information about your telephone friend confidential.
			<li>Letting us know if there is anything you need help with.
			<li>Not exchanging gifts with your telephone friend (though we do encourage you to send cards and photos).
			<li>Not exchanging telephone numbers, emails or addresses with your telephone friend.
		</ol>
