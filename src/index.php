		<br><p>No one should be alone at Christmas, yet thousands of elderly people are still alone. Age UK hopes to change that this Christmas,
		with our new initiative, Age Connect.
		Age Connect is our national telephone friendship service for people in later life. Our team of volunteers provide a valuable and rewarding
		service to thousands of elderly people across the UK, by giving people who need it most a friend whom they can talk to each week. </p>

			<h6 class="header col s12 bold">What does it involve?</h6>
			<br><p>We are recruiting for new volunteers to make weekly calls to support and befriend people who may be socially isolated. 
			As a volunteer, you will be committed to a weekly half-hour call. This is a rewarding long-term commitment. 
			Nearly 90% of our volunteers report intending to continue volunteering over the next 12 months.
			If you can't make a call on any particular week, that's no problem! Our team of full-time workers are always here for support and to ensure your match receives a weekly call.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col s6">
			<h6 class="header col s12 bold">What's in it for you?</h6>
			<br><p>Once you start your Age Connect journey with us, we’ll train you, support you and then match you with an older person who’s waiting for your call. 
			Each week, you’ll enjoy a phone chat, learn about the person you’re calling and have our support every step of the way. 
			Many of our volunteers &#8212; over 85% report a sense of happiness and satisfaction from volunteering on this programme. 
			Full support will be offered to our volunteers, with induction and training programmes, regular communication to keep you updated,
			and advice from a named member of staff who will listen to any feedback or concerns you may have.</p>

			<br><p>Thankyou for reading this far! So Age Connect sounds like something you would like to volunteer for? 
			To sign up, we have a short sign-up form, and then while we validate any necessary legal checks, you will have access to 
			our online training portal. You will also be able to change your profile, which we use to match you to someone who you'll likely get on with!
			As soon as your application is validated you will be able to find a match with an elderly person waiting for your call.</p>
